    <h1>UI testing</h1>
    <section class="introduction">
      <p>
        UI testing is a type of software testing that focuses on the graphical
        user interface (GUI) of an application. It involves verifying that the
        UI behaves as expected under various conditions and that it meets the
        design specifications.
      </p>
      <h2>Key aspects of UI testing:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Visual elements: Ensures that the UI elements, such as buttons, text
          fields, and images, are displayed correctly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Layout and alignment: Checks that the UI components are aligned
          properly and that the layout is consistent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Responsiveness: Tests the UI's behavior on different screen sizes and
          devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Accessibility: Ensures that the UI is accessible to users with
          disabilities.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Lesson 1: Design file types</h2>
      <p>
        In this lesson, you will learn about the different types of design files
        used in the real projects and how to use them.
      </p>
      <h3>Design file types</h3>
      <p>
        There are several types of design files used in the real projects. The
        most common types are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Figma</li>
        <li>PSD</li>
        <li>Adobe XD</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the above design files, you can check the exactly size, color, and
        other properties of the elements.
      </p>
      <h3>Figma</h3>
      <p>
        Figma is a cloud-based design tool that is widely used for UI design. It
        allows you to create and collaborate on designs in real-time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sample design file:
        <a
          href="https://www.figma.com/design/b0yqDROBNw4RvrsKMfjGeh/Manage-product?node-id=0-1&m=dev&t=0rj3nq7kCcl5VsI6-1"
          >Figma link</a
        >
        (You need to login to your Figma/Google account to access developer
        mode)
      </p>
      <p>As you can see in the below image:</p>
      <img
        src="resources/ui_testing/figma/login_button.png"
        alt="Figma example"
      />
      <p>
        Usually, you will get the design file from the designer, and you only
        have view permission only. The designer can share the link with option
      </p>
      <p>
        As a tester, you should know the below features of the Figma to make
        your work easier.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Inspect element</h4>
          <p>
            In the Figma, you just to need to left click the element to inspect
            it. And you can see the properties of the element in the property
            tab on the right.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Copy the text from design</h4>
          <p>
            The easiest way to copy the text from design is to use the
            <code>cmd + c</code> or <code>ctrl + c</code> shortcut.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, sometimes the text layer is after many layers, and you need
            to select the correct text layer to copy the text. To do that, you
            need to take a look to layer type on the left side of Figma. The
            text layer will have the <code>T</code> icon.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Find the distance between two elements</h4>
          <p>
            To find the distance between two elements, you can use click on the
            first element, then hold the Shift key and hover to the second
            element that you want to find the distance.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Find the the text in whole page</h4>
          <p>
            In the Figma, you cannot use the <code>cmd + f</code> or
            <code>ctrl + f</code> shortcut to find the text in whole page. The
            only way to find the text in whole page is to use the extension from
            Figma.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>PSD</h3>
      <p>
        PSD is a file format used for Adobe Photoshop. It is used to create and
        edit images.
      </p>
      <h3>Adobe XD</h3>
      <p>
        Adobe XD is a design tool that is used to create and edit UI designs. It
        is used to create and edit UI designs.

      <h2>Lesson 2: Inspect elements on websites</h2>
      <p>
        In this lesson, you will learn how to inspect elements on websites and
        how to use it for UI testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, you already know how to inspect elements from the design files, you
        will get the expected result. Now, you need to inspect elements on the
        websites, to get the actual result.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this course, we will use the Chrome DevTools to inspect elements on
        the websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can open this sample login page:
        <a href="./sample_pages/sample_login.html" target="_blank"
          >Login page</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        To open the Chrome DevTools, you need to right click on the page and
        select <code>Inspect</code>.
      </p>
      <img
        src="resources/ui_testing/browser_interaction/Button_inspect.png"
        alt="Inspect elements"
      />
      <p>
        After that, you can see the elements on the website and the properties
        of the elements.
