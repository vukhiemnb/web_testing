    <section class="introduction">
      <p>
        UI testing is a type of software testing that focuses on the graphical
        user interface (GUI) of an application. It involves verifying that the
        UI behaves as expected under various conditions and that it meets the
        design specifications.
      </p>
      <h2>Key aspects of UI testing:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Visual elements: Ensures that the UI elements, such as buttons, text
          fields, and images, are displayed correctly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Layout and alignment: Checks that the UI components are aligned
          properly and that the layout is consistent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Responsiveness: Tests the UI's behavior on different screen sizes and
          devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Accessibility: Ensures that the UI is accessible to users with
          disabilities.
        </li>
      </ul>
